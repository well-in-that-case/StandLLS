# StandLLS
Intellisense bindings for the Stand Lua API. Compatible with Sumneko's Lua-Language-Server.

# Installation
Installation is remarkably simple. Download the `stand-lls.lua` file and place it inside the `lib` folder — or any local directory, for the matter — and your extension will read the intellisense.
